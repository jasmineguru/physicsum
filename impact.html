                    Tesla’s goal for their company, specifically towards their cars, is “to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.” The Tesla  Model S is the company’s leading car to represent their goal of making an electric, sustainable car future as it is a 100% electric fueled that according to Tesla has a range of 600km (meaning it can run without charge for 600km Not only is the car a non-polluter, the materials that make up the Model S is reused. When the car has reached the end of its life cycle, instead of being thrown in a recycling bin, it is compressed into a relatively into a sheet of metal. This now thick sheet of metal can be reused to create more cars, put into use for other Tesla projects, or be sold to other automotive companies.  Additionally, 30% of used Lithium-ion batteries are turned into slag(stony waste matter extracted from metal) which is then sold to metal manufacturers and cement manufacturers. By doing so, they are essentially reducing their lithium battery waste by 30% which then means their CO2 emissions are reduced by that amount as well.

                    <li>Jonathan Harris and his team from Engaged Tracking, a CO2 emissions company based in Britain, beg to ask the questions “Is the Tesla Model S really green?”. He compares the average petroleum car with the Tesla Model S to see the difference in CO2 emissions. The result of their experiment was that both cars released the same amount of CO2 emissions which is 1.5 tons annually. He compares the He then decided to compare the Model S to other electric cars to see if it stands out amongst them. He found that the majority of them produce fewer emissions than the Model S, making it not as green as what it is branded to be. For example, another popular electric car that goes by the name of BMW i3 shows to produce 1.3 tons of CO2 emissions annually. </li>
                    <li>In terms of raw materials, Tesla wastes their materials. According to Business Insider, 40% of the raw materials of production gets scrapped (it goes to waste).  Business Insider decided to discuss this matter with Elon Musk (the CEO of Tesla) himself in June of 2018. He defends his case firstly by stating that since January of 2018, the number of raw materials gone to waste had decreased by 60% which considering when the interview was done, this improvement was done within 5-6 months time. He also mentions that the reason why a lot of parts are put to waste is so that only the best materials are putten into making their luxury cars. However, the is seemingly unnecessary since other car companies such as General Motors or Toyota. </li>

              <h2 class = "h2v2">Societal Impacts</h2>

                <p> <img class = "rgimg" src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/zb24b/s1/tesla-model-s-interior-flawed-here-are-the-fixes.jpg"  width="625" height="405" align="left"> There are several features of the car that will definitely benefit the consumers. One aspect is the app component where the driver can tap a function on their phone to call upon their car which will autonomously drive to their driver so long the driver is within 200ft (61 metres). Another feature is the bioweapon defence mode in which the HEPA(high-efficiency particulate air) air filter in the car removes a minimum of 99.97% pollutants, bacteria and other contaminants from coming into the car. A fun feature that every passenger will enjoy is the 17” integrated tablet. The tablet can be used to help function the car like opening the windows or can be used for entertainment purposes. And the final and most exciting feature of the Tesla Model S, auto-pilot. Several actions can be done with the autopilot mode such as navigation and auto parking. With navigation, the 12 sensors located around the vehicle is able to detect it’ surrounding so it can make turns/switch lanes when needed and he used to avoid collisions. The auto parking is straightforward where those same sensors help the car park by itself. To `1prove the Model S’ safety abilities, NHTSA(The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) gives the car 5 stars inside passenger, side roll driver, frontal driver, frontal passenger and overall (2019). </p>
