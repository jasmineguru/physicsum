          <h2> The 'Regen' </h2>

        All Tesla Cars, including the model S uses something called the regenerative braking or ‘Regen’. The function of this system is to convert the car’s kinetic energy into c chemical energy which can be stored in the battery of the car and then be used later as fuel for the car, thus, the term regenerative. <br/>
         Instead of using internal combustion engines like a traditional vehicle since it uses a simple alternative current (AC) single motor, the Model S has an advanced algorithm in the motor to which gives the motor full capability to control torque force which is converted into voltage and current waveforms, thus, energy. The capability for the motor to be in command of torque is key to have an efficient method of energy regeneration through torque. It can determine when to use a positive or negative torque(negative meaning to go in the opposite direction) and he speed at which the motors are spinning.  These factor come into play when extracting the most energy gainable to max efficiency. It is when the motors decelerate, the energy starts to go back to the battery, where the cycle will begin again. That being said, even when the car slows down for the slightest chance, the smallest amount of energy will be stored in the battery. This can happen when stopping at a red light, busy in rush hour traffic, or even a simple three second stop sign halt. <br/>
        Not all of the energy can be converted as some is released into the air and other places as mentioned earlier. That being said, not 100% of kinetic energy is converted into chemical energy, meaning, not 100% of the energy will be reused in the cycle. Energy is released during the conversion from DC current  (battery) to AC current, when working the motor itself, torque(spin on wheel) and vice versa when energy is returned to the battery. However, a lot of the energy lost if from friction working against the car and aerodynamics. 	According to Tesla, the battery to wheel conversion efficiency is approximately 80%  and amount of energy regenerated is also 80% in which the two are multiplied the net efficiency results to be 64%.</p>
